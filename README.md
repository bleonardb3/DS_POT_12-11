## Hands-on Introduction to Watson Studio

## Description:

Work with IBM's Watson Studio in this workshop to build, train, and test machine learning models. Participants will be led through the following four hands-on labs. Note, the first lab is a prerequisite for the other labs. Once Lab-1 is completed, the other labs can be done in any order.  

1. [Lab-1](Lab-1) - This lab will set up the environment for the subsequent labs. 
1. [Lab-2](Lab-2) - This lab will demonstrate the new and exciting AutoAI capability to build and deploy an optimized model based on the Titanic data set. 
1. [Lab-3](Lab-3) - This lab will feature the Watson Studio SPSS modeler to demonstrate visual drag and drop creation of a machine learning model using the Titanic data set. 
1. [Lab-4](Lab-4) - This lab will feature Watson OpenScale. IBM Watson OpenScale is an open platform that helps remove barriers to enterprise-scale AI. It supports bias detection/mitigation, explainability, accuracy monitoring, and drift detection among other features.
